# Winkel Pro-II Board

## Overview
The Winkel Pro-II Board is a unique, advanced & evolved version of the Winkel Pro-I Board. It is Arduino IDE compatible board that is more advanced than many of the popular advanced maker boards in the market. Also built on top of Atmel ATmega128, it goes a step further housing many of the popular known WiFi, Radio and Bluetooth chips on board. Targeted at advanced level makers, this Pro-II version provides a complete integrated solution for several projects.

## Technology
The Winkel Pro Board is a microcontroller based board built on [ATmega128](https://www.google.com), an 8-bit microncontroller that has 128KB of Flash memory and 4KB of RAM. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or with a 5v micro USB power adapter.  
The Pro version houses an Onboard WiFi module in the form of ESP8266 ESP12-E, an Onboard bluetooth in the form HM-10 BLE 4.0 module, an Onboard Radio transceiver in the form of NRF24l01, an Onboard Real time clock in the form of DS3231, Onboard Infrared transceivers, Onboard Accelerometer + Gyroscope and an Integrated SD card slot for data logging needs. The Onboard components are built with Smart Opt, which means that they can be powered down if you have no use of that chip in your project.  
This Pro-II board also supports OTA prgramming. This means you can burn your code on ESP8266 and on the microcontroller ATmega128 wirelessy Over The Air.  
**Complete wireless programming** is useful in the sense when a board is already soldered in any project you want to make some changes to the code you burned on the microncontroller, you can easily do it wirelessy.
