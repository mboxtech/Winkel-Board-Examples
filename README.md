Winkel Board - A new Open Source Hardware Platform

Winkel Board is a new Open hardware platform for makers who work on electronic projects which involve a lot of I/O operations and involves using different communication protocols to fulfill different tasks. 
Winkel Board is also for engineers and hardware hackers who are looking to build and prototype products of tomorrow, but have to spend time looking for the right components to use and then spend more time figuring out how they can be interfaced together as it requires knowledge of various chips and their libraries.
